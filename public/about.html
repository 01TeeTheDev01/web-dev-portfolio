        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>
            I'm Tshego, a passionate learner on a quest to master the art of web development. With a strong foundation in Java and C#, I've embarked on an exciting journey into the world of web technologies. Currently focused on mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I'm eager to dive deeper into frameworks like React and Node.js to create intuitive and dynamic web experiences. <br />
            My approach to learning is driven by a love for problem-solving and a keen interest in creating efficient, user-friendly solutions. I believe in the power of continuous improvement and am dedicated to refining my skills through hands-on projects and exploring new technologies. <br />
            Outside of coding, you might find me gaming, brainstorming new project ideas, or immersing myself in a new experience. I'm always seeking opportunities to collaborate with like-minded people and contribute to impactful projects. <br />
            Join me on this journey as I strive to grow, learn, and make meaningful contributions to the ever-evolving field of web development.
